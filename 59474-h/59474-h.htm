<h3><a name="PART_ONE" id="PART_ONE">PART ONE</a></h3>




<h4><a id="MY_HEART_BEING_HUNGRY"></a>MY HEART, BEING HUNGRY</h4>


<p>My heart, being hungry, feeds on food<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">The fat of heart despise.</span><br />
Beauty where beauty never stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And sweet where no sweet lies</span><br />
I gather to my querulous need,<br />
Having a growing heart to feed.<br />
<br />
It may be, when my heart is dull,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Having attained its girth,</span><br />
I shall not find so beautiful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">The meagre shapes of earth,</span><br />
Nor linger in the rain to mark<br />
The smell of tansy through the dark.<br /></p>




<h4><a id="AUTUMN_CHANT"></a>AUTUMN CHANT</h4>


<p>Now the autumn shudders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">In the rose's root.</span><br />
Far and wide the ladders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Lean among the fruit.</span><br />
<br />
Now the autumn clambers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Up the trellised frame,</span><br />
And the rose remembers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">The dust from which it came.</span><br />
<br />
Brighter than the blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">On the rose's bough</span><br />
Sits the wizened, orange,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Bitter berry now;</span><br />
<br />
Beauty never slumbers;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">All is in her name;</span><br />
But the rose remembers<br /></p>




<h4><a id="NUIT_BLANCHE"></a>NUIT BLANCHE</h4>


<p>I am a shepherd of those sheep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">That climb a wall by night,</span><br />
One after one, until I sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Or the black pane goes white.</span><br />
Because of which I cannot see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">A flock upon a hill,</span><br />
But doubts come tittering up to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">That should by day be still.</span><br />
And childish griefs I have outgrown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Into my eyes are thrust,</span><br />
Till my dull tears go dropping down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Like lead into the dust.</span><br /></p>




<h4><a id="THREE_SONGS_FROM_THE_LAMP_AND_THE_BELL"></a>THREE SONGS FROM THE LAMP AND THE BELL</h4>




<h5>I</h5>


<p>Oh, little rose tree, bloom!<br />
Summer is nearly over.<br />
The dahlias bleed, and the phlox is seed.<br />
Nothing's left of the clover.<br />
And the path of the poppy no one knows.<br />
I would blossom if I were a rose.<br />
<br />
Summer, for all your guile,<br />
Will brown in a week to Autumn,<br />
And launched leaves throw a shadow below<br />
Over the brook's clear bottom,--<br />
And the chariest bud the year can boast<br />
Be brought to bloom by the chastening frost.<br /></p>




<h5>II</h5>


<p>Beat me a crown of bluer metal;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Fret it with stones of a foreign style:</span><br />
The heart grows weary after a little<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Of what it loved for a little while.</span><br />
<br />
Weave me a robe of richer fibre;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Pattern its web with a rare device.</span><br />
Give away to the child of a neighbor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">This gold gown I was glad in twice.</span><br />
<br />
But buy me a singer to sing one song--<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Song about nothing--song about sheep--</span><br />
Over and over, all day long;<br /></p>




<h5>III</h5>


<p>Rain comes down<br />
And hushes the town.<br />
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br />
<br />
Snow settles<br />
Over the nettles.<br />
Where is the voice that I heard crying?<br />
<br />
Sand at last<br />
On the drifting mast.<br />
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br />
<br />
Earth now<br />
On the busy brow.<br />
And where is the voice that I heard crying?<br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_WOOD_ROAD"></a>THE WOOD ROAD</h4>


<p>If I were to walk this way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Hand in hand with Grief,</span><br />
I should mark that maple-spray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Coming into leaf.</span><br />
I should note how the old burrs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Rot upon the ground.</span><br />
Yes, though Grief should know me hers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">While the world goes round,</span><br />
It could not in truth be said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">This was lost on me;</span><br />
A rock-maple showing red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Burrs beneath a tree.</span><br /></p>




<h4><a id="FEAST"></a>FEAST</h4>


<p>I drank at every vine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">The last was like the first.</span><br />
I came upon no wine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">So wonderful as thirst.</span><br />
<br />
I gnawed at every root.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">I ate of every plant.</span><br />
I came upon no fruit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">So wonderful as want.</span><br />
<br />
Feed the grape and bean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">To the vintner and monger;</span><br />
I will lie down lean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">With my thirst and my hunger.</span><br /></p>




<h4><a id="SOUVENIR"></a>SOUVENIR</h4>


<p>Just a rainy day or two<br />
In a windy tower,<br />
That was all I had of you--<br />
Saving half an hour.<br />
<br />
Marred by greeting passing groups<br />
In a cinder walk,<br />
Near some naked blackberry hoops<br />
Dim with purple chalk.<br />
<br />
I remember three or four<br />
Things you said in spite,<br />
And an ugly coat you wore,<br />
Plaided black and white.<br />
<br />
Just a rainy day or two<br />
And a bitter word.<br />
Why do I remember you<br />
As a singing bird?<br /></p>




<h4><a id="SCRUB"></a>SCRUB</h4>


<p>If I grow bitterly,<br />
Like a gnarled and stunted tree,<br />
Bearing harshly of my youth<br />
Puckered fruit that sears the mouth;<br />
If I make of my drawn boughs<br />
An inhospitable house,<br />
Out of which I never pry<br />
Towards the water and the sky,<br />
Under which I stand and hide<br />
And hear the day go by outside;<br />
It is that a wind too strong<br />
Bent my back when I was young,<br />
It is that I fear the rain<br />
Lest it blister me again.<br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_GOOSE_GIRL"></a>THE GOOSE-GIRL</h4>


<p>Spring rides no horses down the hill,<br />
But comes on foot, a goose-girl still.<br />
And all the loveliest things there be<br />
Come simply, so, it seems to me.<br />
If ever I said, in grief or pride,<br />
I tired of honest things, I lied;<br />
And should be cursed forevermore<br />
With Love in laces, like a whore,<br />
And neighbors cold, and friends unsteady,<br />
And Spring on horseback, like a lady!<br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_DRAGONFLY"></a>THE DRAGONFLY</h4>


<p>I wound myself in a white cocoon of singing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">All day long in the brook's uneven bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Measuring out my soul in a mucous thread;</span><br />
Dimly now to the brook's green bottom clinging,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Men behold me, a worm spun-out and dead,</span><br />
Walled in an iron house of silky singing.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless at length, O reedy shallows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Not as a plodding nose to the slimy stem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">But as a brazen wing with a spangled hem,</span><br />
Over the jewel-weed and the pink marshmallows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Free of these and making a song of them,</span><br />
I shall arise, and a song of the reedy shallows!<br /></p>




<h3><a name="PART_TWO" id="PART_TWO">PART TWO</a></h3>




<h4><a id="DEPARTURE"></a>DEPARTURE</h4>


<p>It's little I care what path I take,<br />
And where it leads it's little I care;<br />
But out of this house, lest my heart break,<br />
I must go, and off somewhere.<br />
<br />
It's little I know what's in my heart,<br />
What's in my mind it's little I know,<br />
But there's that in me must up and start,<br />
And it's little I care where my feet go.<br />
<br />
I wish I could walk for a day and a night,<br />
And find me at dawn in a desolate place<br />
With never the rut of a road in sight,<br />
Nor the roof of a house, nor the eyes of a face.<br />
<br />
I wish I could walk till my blood should spout,<br />
And drop me, never to stir again,<br />
On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out,<br />
And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain.<br />
<br />
But dump or dock, where the path I take<br />
Brings up, it's little enough I care;<br />
And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make,<br />
Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere.<br />
<br />
<i>"Is something the matter, dear," she said,</i><br />

<h4><a id="THE_RETURN_FROM_TOWN"></a>THE RETURN FROM TOWN</h4>


<p>As I sat down by Saddle Stream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">To bathe my dusty feet there,</span><br />
A boy was standing on the bridge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Any girl would meet there.</span><br />
<br />
As I went over Woody Knob<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And dipped into the hollow,</span><br />
A youth was coming up the hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Any maid would follow.</span><br />
<br />
Then in I turned at my own gate,--<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And nothing to be sad for--</span><br />
To such a man as any wife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Would pass a pretty lad for.</span><br /></p>




<h4><a id="A_VISIT_TO_THE_ASYLUM"></a>A VISIT TO THE ASYLUM</h4>


<p>Once from a big, big building,<br />
When I was small, small,<br />
The queer folk in the windows<br />
Would smile at me and call.<br />
<br />
And in the hard wee gardens<br />
Such pleasant men would hoe:<br />
"Sir, may we touch the little girl's hair?"--<br />
It was so red, you know.<br />
<br />
They cut me colored asters<br />
With shears so sharp and neat,<br />
They brought me grapes and plums and pears<br />
And pretty cakes to eat.<br />
<br />
And out of all the windows,<br />
No matter where we went,<br />
The merriest eyes would follow me<br />
And make me compliment.<br />
<br />
There were a thousand windows,<br />
All latticed up and down.<br />
And up to all the windows,<br />
When we went back to town,<br />
<br />
The queer folk put their faces,<br />
As gentle as could be;<br />
"Come again, little girl!" they called, and I<br />
Called back, "You come see me!"<br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_SPRING_AND_THE_FALL"></a>THE SPRING AND THE FALL</h4>


<p>In the spring of the year, in the spring of the year,<br />
I walked the road beside my dear.<br />
The trees were black where the bark was wet.<br />
I see them yet, in the spring of the year.<br />
He broke me a bough of the blossoming peach<br />
That was out of the way and hard to reach.<br />
<br />
In the fall of the year, in the fall of the year,<br />
I walked the road beside my dear.<br />
The rooks went up with a raucous trill.<br />
I hear them still, in the fall of the year.<br />
He laughed at all I dared to praise,<br />
And broke my heart, in little ways.<br />
<br />
Year be springing or year be falling,<br />
The bark will drip and the birds be calling.<br />
There's much that's fine to see and hear<br />
In the spring of a year, in the fall of a year.<br />
'Tis not love's going hurts my days,<br />
But that it went in little ways.<br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_CURSE"></a>THE CURSE</h4>


<p>Oh, lay my ashes on the wind<br />
That blows across the sea.<br />
And I shall meet a fisherman<br />
Out of Capri,<br />
<br />
And he will say, seeing me,<br />
"What a strange thing!<br />
Like a fish's scale or a<br />
Butterfly's wing."<br />
<br />
Oh, lay my ashes on the wind<br />
That blows away the fog.<br />
And I shall meet a farmer boy<br />
Leaping through the bog,<br />
<br />
And he will say, seeing me,<br />
"What a strange thing!<br />
Like a peat-ash or a<br />
Butterfly's wing."<br />
<br />
And I shall blow to your house<br />
And, sucked against the pane,<br />
See you take your sewing up<br />
And lay it down again.<br />
<br />
And you will say, seeing me,<br />
"What a strange thing!<br />
Like a plum petal or a<br />
Butterfly's wing."<br />
<br />
And none at all will know me<br />
That knew me well before.<br />
But I will settle at the root<br />
That climbs about your door,<br />
<br />
And fishermen and farmers<br />
May see me and forget,<br />
But I'll be a bitter berry<br />
In your brewing yet.<br /></p>

<p>Weep him dead and mourn as you may,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Me, I sing as I must:</span><br />
Blessed be Death, that cuts in marble<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">What would have sunk to dust!</span><br />
<br />
Blessed be Death, that took my love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And buried him in the sea,</span><br />
Where never a lie nor a bitter word<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Will out of his mouth at me.</span><br />
<br />
This I have to hold to my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">This to take by the hand:</span><br />
Sweet we were for a summer month<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">As the sun on the dry white sand;</span><br />
<br />
Mild we were for a summer month<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">As the wind from over the weirs.</span><br />
And blessed be Death, that hushed with salt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">The harsh and slovenly years!</span><br />
<br />
Who builds her a house with love for timber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Builds her a house of foam.</span><br />
And I'd rather be bride to a lad gone down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Than widow to one safe home.</span><br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_BETROTHAL"></a>THE BETROTHAL</h4>


<p>Oh, come, my lad, or go, my lad,<br />
And love me if you like.<br />
I shall not hear the door shut<br />
Nor the knocker strike.<br />
<br />
Oh, bring me gifts or beg me gifts,<br />
And wed me if you will.<br />
I'd make a man a good wife,<br />
Sensible and still.<br />
<br />
And why should I be cold, my lad,<br />
And why should you repine,<br />
Because I love a dark head<br />
That never will be mine?<br />
<br />
I might as well be easing you<br />
As lie alone in bed<br />
And waste the night in wanting<br />
A cruel dark head.<br />
<br />
You might as well be calling yours<br />
What never will be his,<br />
And one of us be happy.<br />
There's few enough as is.<br /></p>

<p>In this pond of placid water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Half a hundred years ago,</span><br />
So they say, a farmer's daughter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Jilted by her farmer beau,</span><br />
<br />
Waded out among the rushes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Scattering the blue dragon-flies;</span><br />
That dried stick the ripple washes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Marks the spot, I should surmise.</span><br />
<br />
Think, so near the public highway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Well frequented even then!</span><br />
Can you not conceive the sly way,--<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Hearing wheels or seeing men</span><br />
<br />
Passing on the road above,--<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">With a gesture feigned and silly,</span><br />
Ere she drowned herself for love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">She would reach to pluck a lily?</span><br /></p>




<h4><a id="THE_BALLAD_OF_THE_HARP_WEAVER"></a>THE BALLAD OF THE HARP-WEAVER</h4>


<p>"Son," said my mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">When I was knee-high,</span><br />
"You've need of clothes to cover you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And not a rag have I.</span><br />
<br />
"There's nothing in the house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">To make a boy breeches,</span><br />
Nor shears to cut a cloth with<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Nor thread to take stitches.</span><br />
<br />
"There's nothing in the house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">But a loaf-end of rye,</span><br />
And a harp with a woman's head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Nobody will buy,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And she began to cry.</span><br />
<br />
That was in the early fall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">When came the late fall,</span><br />
"Son," she said, "the sight of you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Makes your mother's blood crawl,--</span><br />
<br />
"Little skinny shoulder-blades<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Sticking through your clothes!</span><br />
And where you'll get a jacket from<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">God above knows.</span><br />
<br />
 "It's lucky for me, lad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Your daddy's in the ground,</span><br />
And can't see the way I let<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">His son go around!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And she made a queer sound.</span><br />
<br />
That was in the late fall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">When the winter came,</span><br />
I'd not a pair of breeches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Nor a shirt to my name.</span><br />
<br />
I couldn't go to school,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Or out of doors to play.</span><br />
And all the other little boys<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Passed our way.</span><br />
<br />
"Son," said my mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">"Come, climb into my lap,</span><br />
And I'll chafe your little bones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">While you take a nap."</span><br />
<br />
And, oh, but we were silly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">For half an hour or more,</span><br />
Me with my long legs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Dragging on the floor,</span><br />
<br />
A-rock-rock-rocking<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">To a mother-goose rhyme!</span><br />
Oh, but we were happy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">For half an hour's time!</span><br />
<br />
But there was I, a great boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And what would folks say</span><br />
To hear my mother singing me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">To sleep all day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">In such a daft way?</span><br />
<br />
Men say the winter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Was bad that year;</span><br />
Fuel was scarce,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And food was dear.</span><br />
<br />
A wind with a wolf's head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Howled about our door,</span><br />
And we burned up the chairs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And sat upon the floor.</span><br />
<br />
All that was left us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Was a chair we couldn't break,</span><br />
And the harp with a woman's head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Nobody would take,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">For song or pity's sake.</span><br />
<br />
The night before Christmas<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">I cried with the cold,</span><br />
I cried myself to sleep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Like a two-year-old.</span><br />
<br />
And in the deep night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">I felt my mother rise,</span><br />
And stare down upon me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">With love in her eyes.</span><br />
<br />
I saw my mother sitting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">On the one good chair,</span><br />
A light falling on her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">From I couldn't tell where,</span><br />
<br />
Looking nineteen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And not a day older,</span><br />
And the harp with a woman's head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Leaned against her shoulder.</span><br />
<br />
Her thin fingers, moving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">In the thin, tall strings,</span><br />
Were weav-weav-weaving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Wonderful things.</span><br />
<br />
Many bright threads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">From where I couldn't see,</span><br />
Were running through the harp-strings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Rapidly,</span><br />
<br />
And gold threads whistling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Through my mother's hand.</span><br />
I saw the web grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And the pattern expand.</span><br />
<br />
She wove a child's jacket,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And when it was done</span><br />
She laid it on the floor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And wove another one.</span><br />
<br />
She wove a red cloak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">So regal to see,</span><br />
"She's made it for a king's son,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">I said, "and not for me."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">But I knew it was for me.</span><br />
<br />
She wove a pair of breeches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Quicker than that!</span><br />
She wove a pair of boots<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And a little cocked hat.</span><br />
<br />
She wove a pair of mittens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">She wove a little blouse,</span><br />
She wove all night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">In the still, cold house.</span><br />
<br />
She sang as she worked,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And the harp-strings spoke;</span><br />
Her voice never faltered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And the thread never broke.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And when I awoke,--</span><br />
<br />
There sat my mother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">With the harp against her shoulder,</span><br />
Looking nineteen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And not a day older,</span><br />
<br />
A smile about her lips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And a light about her head,</span><br />
And her hands in the harp-strings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Frozen dead.</span><br />
<br />
And piled up beside her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">And toppling to the skies,</span><br />
Were the clothes of a king's son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">Just my size.</span><br /></p>

<p>Never, never may the fruit be plucked from the<br />

And gathered into barrels.<br />
He that would eat of love must eat it where it hangs.<br />
Though the branches bend like reeds,<br />

He that would eat of love may bear away with him<br />
Only what his belly can hold,<br />
Nothing in the apron,<br />
Nothing in the pockets.<br />
Never, never may the fruit be gathered from the<br />

Why may you not come with me?--<br />
You are too much my lover.<br />
You would put yourself<br />

If I go alone,<br />
Quiet and suavely clothed,<br />
My body will die in its chair,<br />
And over my head a flame,<br />
A mind that is twice my own,<br />
Will mark with icy mirth<br />
The wise advance and retreat<br />
Of armies without a country,<br />
Storming a nameless gate,<br />
Hurling terrible javelins down<br />
From the shouting walls of a singing town<br />
Where no women wait!<br />
<br />
Armies clean of love and hate,<br />
Marching lines of pitiless sound<br />
Climbing hills to the sun and hurling<br />
Golden spears to the ground!<br />
<br />
Up the lines a silver runner<br />
Bearing a banner whereon is scored<br />
The milk and steel of a bloodless wound<br />
Healed at length by the sword!<br />
<br />
You and I have nothing to do with music.<br />
We may not make of music a filigree frame,<br />
Within which you and I,<br />
Tenderly glad we came,<br />
Sit smiling, hand in hand.<br />

Come now, be content.<br />

You must reply, as well as with most, you fancy;<br />

And she will not know how all day long between<br />
My life and me her shadow intervenes,<br />
A young thin girl,<br />
Wearing a white skirt and a purple sweater<br />
And a narrow pale blue ribbon about her hair.<br />

I used to say to her, "I love you<br />

Rise, and the names of the mountains and the principal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">cities,</span><br />
My heart breaks.<br />
Come up, children! Toss your little stones gaily<br />
On the great cairn of Knowledge!<br />
(Where lies what Euclid knew, a little gray stone,<br />
What Plato, what Pascal, what Galileo:<br />
Little gray stones, little gray stones on a cairn.)<br />
Tell me, what is the name of the highest mountain?<br />
Name me a crater of fire! a peak of snow!<br />
Name me the mountains on the moon!<br />

<h4><a id="SPRING_SONG"></a>SPRING SONG</h4>


<p>I know why the yellow forsythia<br />
Holds its breath and will not bloom,<br />
And the robin thrusts his beak in his wing.<br />
<br />
Want me to tell you? Think you can bear it?<br />
Cover your eyes with your hand and hear it.<br />
You know how cold the days are still?<br />
And everybody saying how late the Spring is?<br />
Well--cover your eyes with your hand--the thing is,<br />
There isn't going to be any Spring.<br />
<br />
<i>No parking here! No parking here!<br />
They said to Spring: No parking here!</i><br />
<br />
Spring came on as she always does,<br />
Laid her hand on the yellow forsythia,--<br />
Little boys turned in their sleep and smiled,<br />
Dreaming of marbles, dreaming of agates;<br />
Little girls leapt from their beds to see<br />
Spring come by with her painted wagons,<br />
Colored wagons creaking with wonder--<br />
<br />
Laid her hand on the robin's throat;<br />
When up comes you-know-who, my dear,<br />
You-know-who in a fine blue coat,<br />
And says to Spring: No parking here!<br />
<br />
<i>No parking here! No parking here!<br />
Move on! Move on! No parking here!</i><br />
<br />
Come walk with me in the city gardens.<br />
(Better keep an eye out for you-know-who)<br />
Did ever you see such a sickly showing?--<br />
Middle of June, and nothing growing;<br />
The gardeners peer and scratch their heads<br />
And drop their sweat on the tulip-beds,<br />
But not a blade thrusts through.<br />
<br />
<i>Come, move on! Don't you know how to walk?<br />
No parking here! And no back-talk!</i><br />
<br />
Oh, well--hell, it's all for the best.<br />
She certainly made a lot of clutter,<br />
Dropping petals under the trees,<br />
Taking your mind off your bread and butter.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it's nothing to me.<br />
I can remember, and so can you.<br />
(Though we'd better watch out for you-know-who,<br />
When we sit around remembering Spring).<br />
<br />
We shall hardly notice in a year or two.<br />
You can get accustomed to anything.<br /></p>

<h5><a id="IV_I_WHEN_YOU_THAT_AT_THIS_MOMENT"></a>IV-I WHEN YOU, THAT AT THIS MOMENT</h5>


<p>When you, that at this moment are to me<br />
Dearer than words on paper, shall depart,<br />
And be no more the warder of my heart,<br />
Whereof again myself shall hold the key;<br />
And be no more--what now you seem to be--<br />
The sun, from which all excellences start<br />
In a round nimbus, nor a broken dart<br />
Of moonlight, even, splintered on the sea;<br />
I shall remember only of this hour--<br />
And weep somewhat, as now you see me weep--<br />
The pathos of your love, that, like a flower,<br />
Fearful of death yet amorous of sleep,<br />
Droops for a moment and beholds, dismayed,<br />
The wind whereon its petals shall be laid.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_II_THAT_LOVE_AT_LENGTH_SHOULD_FIND"></a>IV-II THAT LOVE AT LENGTH SHOULD FIND</h5>


<p>That Love at length should find me out and bring<br />
This fierce and trivial brow unto the dust,<br />
Is, after all, I must confess, but just;<br />
There is a subtle beauty in this thing,<br />
A wry perfection; wherefore now let sing<br />
All voices how into my throat is thrust,<br />
Unwelcome as Death's own, Love's bitter crust,<br />
All criers proclaim it, and all steeples ring.<br />
This being done, there let the matter rest.<br />
What more remains is neither here nor there.<br />
That you requite me not is plain to see;<br />
Myself your slave herein have I confessed:<br />
Thus far, indeed, the world may mock at me;<br />
But if I suffer, it is my own affair.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_III_LOVE_IS_NOT_BLIND"></a>IV-III LOVE IS NOT BLIND</h5>


<p>Love is not blind. I see with single eye<br />
Your ugliness and other women's grace.<br />
I know the imperfection of your face,--<br />
The eyes too wide apart, the brow too high<br />
For beauty. Learned from earliest youth am I<br />
In loveliness, and cannot so erase<br />
Its letters from my mind, that I may trace<br />
You faultless, I must love until I die.<br />
More subtle is the sovereignty of love:<br />
So am I caught that when I say, "Not fair,"<br />
'Tis but as if I said, "Not here--not there--<br />
Not risen--not writing letters." Well I know<br />
What is this beauty men are babbling of;<br />
I wonder only why they prize it so.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_IV_I_KNOW_I_AM_BUT_SUMMER"></a>IV-IV I KNOW I AM BUT SUMMER</h5>


<p>I know I am but summer to your heart,<br />
And not the full four seasons of the year;<br />
And you must welcome from another part<br />
Such noble moods as are not mine, my dear.<br />
No gracious weight of golden fruits to sell<br />
Have I, nor any wise and wintry thing;<br />
And I have loved you all too long and well<br />
To carry still the high sweet breast of Spring.<br />
Wherefore I say: O love, as summer goes,<br />
I must be gone, steal forth with silent drums,<br />
That you may hail anew the bird and rose<br />
When I come back to you, as summer comes.<br />
Else will you seek, at some not distant time,<br />
Even your summer in another clime.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_V_I_PRAY_YOU_IF_YOU_LOVE_ME"></a>IV-V I PRAY YOU IF YOU LOVE ME</h5>


<p>I pray you if you love me, bear my joy<br />
A little while, or let me weep your tears;<br />
I, too, have seen the quavering Fate destroy<br />
Your destiny's bright spinning--the dull shears<br />
Meeting not neatly, chewing at the thread,--<br />
Nor can you well be less aware how fine,<br />
How staunch as wire, and how unwarranted<br />
Endures the golden fortune that is mine.<br />
I pray you for this day at least, my dear,<br />
Fare by my side, that journey in the sun;<br />
Else must I turn me from the blossoming year<br />
And walk in grief the way that you have gone.<br />
Let us go forth together to the spring:<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_VI_PITY_ME_NOT"></a>IV-VI PITY ME NOT</h5>


<p>Pity me not because the light of day<br />
At close of day no longer walks the sky;<br />
Pity me not for beauties passed away<br />
From field and thicket as the year goes by;<br />
Pity me not the waning of the moon,<br />
Nor that the ebbing tide goes out to sea,<br />
Nor that a man's desire is hushed so soon,<br />
And you no longer look with love on me.<br />
This have I known always: Love is no more<br />
Than the wide blossom which the wind assails,<br />
Than the great tide that treads the shifting shore.<br />
Strewing fresh wreckage gathered in the gales;<br />
Pity me that the heart is slow to learn<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_VII_SOMETIMES_WHEN_I_AM_WEARIED"></a>IV-VII SOMETIMES WHEN I AM WEARIED</h5>


<p>Sometimes when I am wearied suddenly<br />
Of all the things that are the outward you,<br />
And my gaze wanders ere your tale is through<br />
To webs of my own weaving, or I see<br />
Abstractedly your hands about your knee<br />
And wonder why I love you as I do,<br />
Then I recall, "Yet <i>Sorrow</i> thus he drew";<br />
Then I consider, "<i>Pride</i> thus painted he."<br />
Oh, friend, forget not, when you fain would note<br />
In me a beauty that was never mine,<br />
How first you knew me in a book I wrote,<br />
How first you loved me for a written line:<br />
So are we bound till broken is the throat<br />
Of Song, and Art no more leads out the Nine.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_VIII_OH_OH_YOU_WILL_BE_SORRY"></a>IV-VIII OH, OH, YOU WILL BE SORRY</h5>


<p>Oh, oh, you will be sorry for that word!<br />
Give back my book and take my kiss instead.<br />
Was it my enemy or my friend I heard,<br />
"What a big book for such a little head!"<br />
Come, I will show you now my newest hat,<br />
And you may watch me purse my mouth and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">prink!</span><br />
Oh, I shall love you still, and all of that.<br />
I never again shall tell you what I think.<br />
I shall be sweet and crafty, soft and sly;<br />
You will not catch me reading any more:<br />
I shall be called a wife to pattern by;<br />
And some day when you knock and push the door,<br />
Some sane day, not too bright and not too stormy,<br />
I shall be gone, and you may whistle for me.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_IX_HERE_IS_A_WOUND"></a>IV-IX HERE IS A WOUND</h5>


<p>Here is a wound that never will heal, I know,<br />
Being wrought not of a dearness and a death,<br />
But of a love turned ashes and the breath<br />
Gone out of beauty; never again will grow<br />
The grass on that scarred acre, though I sow<br />
Young seed there yearly and the sky bequeath<br />
Its friendly weathers down, far underneath<br />
Shall be such bitterness of an old woe.<br />
That April should be shattered by a gust,<br />
That August should be levelled by a rain,<br />
I can endure, and that the lifted dust<br />
Of man should settle to the earth again;<br />
But that a dream can die, will be a thrust<br />
Between my ribs forever of hot pain.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_X_I_SHALL_GO_BACK_AGAIN"></a>IV-X I SHALL GO BACK AGAIN</h5>


<p>I shall go back again to the bleak shore<br />
And build a little shanty on the sand,<br />
In such a way that the extremest band<br />
Of brittle seaweed will escape my door<br />
But by a yard or two; and nevermore<br />
Shall I return to take you by the hand;<br />
I shall be gone to what I understand,<br />
And happier than I ever was before.<br />
The love that stood a moment in your eyes,<br />
The words that lay a moment on your tongue,<br />
Are one with all that in a moment dies,<br />
A little under-said and over-sung.<br />
But I shall find the sullen rocks and skies<br />
Unchanged from what they were when I was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">young.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XI_SAY_WHAT_YOU_WILL"></a>IV-XI SAY WHAT YOU WILL</h5>


<p>Say what you will, and scratch my heart to find<br />
The roots of last year's roses in my breast;<br />
I am as surely riper in my mind<br />
As if the fruit stood in the stalls confessed.<br />
Laugh at the unshed leaf, say what you will,<br />
Call me in all things what I was before,<br />
A flutterer in the wind, a woman still;<br />
I tell you I am what I was and more.<br />
My branches weigh me down, frost cleans the air,<br />
My sky is black with small birds bearing south;<br />
Say what you will, confuse me with fine care,<br />
Put by my word as but an April truth--<br />
Autumn is no less on me that a rose<br />
Hugs the brown bough and sighs before it goes.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XII_WHATS_THIS_OF_DEATH"></a>IV-XII WHAT'S THIS OF DEATH</h5>


<p>What's this of death, from you who never will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">die?</span><br />
Think you the wrist that fashioned you in clay,<br />
The thumb that set the hollow just that way<br />
In your full throat and lidded the long eye<br />
So roundly from the forehead, will let lie<br />
Broken, forgotten, under foot some day<br />
Your unimpeachable body, and so slay<br />
The work he most had been remembered by?<br />
I tell you this: whatever of dust to dust<br />
Goes down, whatever of ashes may return<br />
To its essential self in its own season,<br />
Loveliness such as yours will not be lost,<br />
But, cast in bronze upon his very urn,<br />
Make known him Master, and for what good<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">reason.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XIII_I_SEE_SO_CLEARLY"></a>IV-XIII I SEE SO CLEARLY</h5>


<p>I see so clearly now my similar years<br />
Repeat each other, shod in rusty black,<br />
Like one hack following another hack<br />
In meaningless procession, dry of tears,<br />
Driven empty, lest the noses sharp as shears<br />
Of gutter-urchins at a hearse's back<br />
Should sniff a man died friendless, and attack<br />
With silly scorn his deaf triumphant ears;<br />
I see so clearly how my life must run<br />
One year behind another year until<br />
At length these bones that leap into the sun<br />
Are lowered into the gravel, and lie still,<br />
I would at times the funeral were done<br />
And I abandoned on the ultimate hill.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XIV_YOUR_FACE_IS_LIKE_A_CHAMBER"></a>IV-XIV YOUR FACE IS LIKE A CHAMBER</h5>


<p>Your face is like a chamber where a king<br />
Dies of his wounds, untended and alone,<br />
Stifling with courteous gesture the crude moan<br />
That speaks too loud of mortal perishing,<br />
Rising on elbow in the dark to sing<br />
Some rhyme now out of season but well known<br />
In days when banners in his face were blown<br />
And every woman had a rose to fling.<br />
I know that through your eyes which look on me<br />
Who stand regarding you with pitiful breath,<br />
You see beyond the moment's pause, you see<br />
The sunny sky, the skimming bird beneath,<br />
And, fronting on your windows hopelessly,<br />
Black in the noon, the broad estates of Death.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XV_THE_LIGHT_COMES_BACK"></a>IV-XV THE LIGHT COMES BACK</h5>


<p>The light comes back with Columbine; she brings<br />
A touch of this, a little touch of that,<br />
Coloured confetti, and a favour hat,<br />
Patches, and powder, dolls that work by strings<br />
And moons that work by switches, all the things<br />
That please a sick man's fancy, and a flat<br />
Spry convalescent kiss, and a small pat<br />
Upon the pillow,--paper offerings.<br />
The light goes out with her; the shadows sprawl.<br />
Where she has left her fragrance like a shawl<br />
I lie alone and pluck the counterpane,<br />
Or on a dizzy elbow rise and hark--<br />
And down like dominoes along the dark<br />
Her little silly laughter spills again!<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XVI_LORD_ARCHER_DEATH"></a>IV-XVI LORD ARCHER, DEATH</h5>


<p>Lord Archer, Death, whom sent you in your<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">stead?</span><br />
What faltering prentice fumbled at your bow,<br />
That now should wander with the insanguine dead<br />
In whom forever the bright blood must flow?<br />
Or is it rather that impairing Time<br />
Renders yourself so random, or so dim?<br />
Or are you sick of shadows and would climb<br />
A while to light, a while detaining him?<br />
For know, this was no mortal youth, to be<br />
Of you confounded, but a heavenly guest,<br />
Assuming earthly garb for love of me,<br />
And hell's demure attire for love of jest:<br />
Bringing me asphodel and a dark feather,<br />
He will return, and we shall laugh together!<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XVII_LOVING_YOU_LESS_THAN_LIFE"></a>IV-XVII LOVING YOU LESS THAN LIFE</h5>


<p>Loving you less than life, a little less<br />
Than bitter-sweet upon a broken wall<br />
Or brush-wood smoke in autumn, I confess<br />
I cannot swear I love you not at all.<br />
For there is that about you in this light--<br />
A yellow darkness, sinister of rain--<br />
Which sturdily recalls my stubborn sight<br />
To dwell on you, and dwell on you again.<br />
And I am made aware of many a week<br />
I shall consume, remembering in what way<br />
Your brown hair grows about your brow and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">cheek,</span><br />
And what divine absurdities you say:<br />
Till all the world, and I, and surely you,<br />
Will know I love you, whether or not I do.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XVIII_I_BEING_BORN_A_WOMAN"></a>IV-XVIII I, BEING BORN A WOMAN</h5>


<p>I, being born a woman and distressed<br />
By all the needs and notions of my kind,<br />
Am urged by your propinquity to find<br />
Your person fair, and feel a certain zest<br />
To bear your body's weight upon my breast:<br />
So subtly is the fume of life designed,<br />
To clarify the pulse and cloud the mind,<br />
And leave me once again undone, possessed.<br />
Think not for this, however, the poor treason<br />
Of my stout blood against my staggering brain,<br />
I shall remember you with love, or season<br />
My scorn with pity,--let me make it plain:<br />
I find this frenzy insufficient reason<br />
For conversation when we meet again.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XIX_WHAT_LIPS_MY_LIPS_HAVE_KISSED"></a>IV-XIX WHAT LIPS MY LIPS HAVE KISSED</h5>


<p>What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">why,</span><br />
I have forgotten, and what arms have lain<br />
Under my head till morning; but the rain<br />
Is full of ghosts to-night, that tap and sigh<br />
Upon the glass and listen for reply,<br />
And in my heart there stirs a quiet pain<br />
For unremembered lads that not again<br />
Will turn to me at midnight with a cry.<br />
Thus in the winter stands the lonely tree,<br />
Nor knows what birds have vanished one by one,<br />
Yet knows its boughs more silent than before:<br />
I cannot say what loves have come and gone,<br />
I only know that summer sang in me<br />
A little while, that in me sings no more.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XX_STILL_WILL_I_HARVEST_BEAUTY"></a>IV-XX STILL WILL I HARVEST BEAUTY</h5>


<p>Still will I harvest beauty where it grows:<br />
In coloured fungus and the spotted fog<br />
Surprised on foods forgotten; in ditch and bog<br />
Filmed brilliant with irregular rainbows<br />
Of rust and oil, where half a city throws<br />
Its empty tins; and in some spongy log<br />
Whence headlong leaps the oozy emerald frog. . . .<br />
And a black pupil in the green scum shows.<br />
Her the inhabiter of divers places<br />
Surmising at all doors, I push them all.<br />
Oh, you that fearful of a creaking hinge<br />
Turn back forevermore with craven faces,<br />
I tell you Beauty bears an ultra fringe<br />
Unguessed of you upon her gossamer shawl!<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XXI_HOW_HEALTHILY_THEIR_FEET"></a>IV-XXI HOW HEALTHILY THEIR FEET</h5>


<p>How healthily their feet upon the floor<br />
Strike down! These are no spirits, but a band<br />
Of children, surely, leaping hand in hand,<br />
Into the air in groups of three and four,<br />
Wearing their silken rags as if they wore<br />
Leaves only and light grasses, or a strand<br />
Of black elusive seaweed oozing sand,<br />
And running hard as if along a shore.<br />
I know how lost forever, and at length<br />
How still these lovely tossing limbs shall lie,<br />
And the bright laughter and the panting breath;<br />
And yet, before such beauty and such strength,<br />
Once more, as always when the dance is high,<br />
I am rebuked that I believe in death.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="IV_XXII_EUCLID_ALONE_HAS_LOOKED"></a>IV-XXII EUCLID ALONE HAS LOOKED</h5>


<p>Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.<br />
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,<br />
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease<br />
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare<br />
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere<br />
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese<br />
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release<br />
From dusty bondage into luminous air.<br />
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,<br />
When first the shaft into his vision shone<br />
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone<br />
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they<br />
Who, though once only and then but far away,<br />
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.<br /></p>

<h5><a id="V_I_SO_SHE_CAME_BACK"></a>V-I SO SHE CAME BACK</h5>


<p>So SHE came back into his house again<br />
And watched beside his bed until he died,<br />
Loving him not at all. The winter rain<br />
Splashed in the painted butter-tub outside,<br />
Where once her red geraniums had stood,<br />
Where still their rotted stalks were to be seen;<br />
The thin log snapped; and she went out for wood,<br />
Bareheaded, running the few steps between<br />
The house and shed; there, from the sodden eaves<br />
Blown back and forth on ragged ends of twine,<br />
Saw the dejected creeping-jinny vine,<br />
(And one, big-aproned, blithe, with stiff blue sleeves<br />
Rolled to the shoulder that warm day in spring,<br />
Who planted seeds, musing ahead to their far <br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">blossoming).</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_II_THE_LAST_WHITE_SAWDUST"></a>V-II THE LAST WHITE SAWDUST</h5>


<p>The last white sawdust on the floor was grown<br />
Gray as the first, so long had he been ill;<br />
The axe was nodding in the block; fresh-blown<br />
And foreign came the rain across the sill,<br />
But on the roof so steadily it drummed<br />
She could not think a time it might not be--<br />
In hazy summer, when the hot air hummed<br />
With mowing, and locusts rising raspingly,<br />
When that small bird with iridescent wings<br />
And long incredible sudden silver tongue<br />
Had just flashed (and yet may be not!) among<br />
The dwarf nasturtiums--when no sagging springs<br />
Of shower were in the whole bright sky, somehow<br />
Upon this roof the rain would drum as it was drumming <br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">now.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_III_SHE_FILLED_HER_ARMS_WITH_WOOD"></a>V-III SHE FILLED HER ARMS WITH WOOD</h5>


<p>She filled her arms with wood, and set her chin<br />
Forward, to hold the highest stick in place,<br />
No less afraid than she had always been<br />
Of spiders up her arms and on her face,<br />
But too impatient for a careful search<br />
Or a less heavy loading, from the heap<br />
Selecting hastily small sticks of birch,<br />
For their curled bark, that instantly will leap<br />
Into a blaze, nor thinking to return<br />
Some day, distracted, as of old, to find<br />
Smooth, heavy, round, green logs with a wet, gray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">rind</span><br />
Only, and knotty chunks that will not burn,<br />
(That day when dust is on the wood-box floor,<br />
And some old catalogue, and a brown, shriveled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">apple core).</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_IV_THE_WHITE_BARK_WRITHED"></a>V-IV THE WHITE BARK WRITHED</h5>


<p>The white bark writhed and sputtered like a fish<br />
Upon the coals, exuding odorous smoke.<br />
She knelt and blew, in a surging desolate wish<br />
For comfort; and the sleeping ashes woke<br />
And scattered to the hearth, but no thin fire<br />
Broke suddenly, the wood was wet with rain.<br />
Then, softly stepping forth from her desire,<br />
(Being mindful of like passion hurled in vain<br />
Upon a similar task, in other days)<br />
She thrust her breath against the stubborn coal,<br />
Bringing to bear upon its hilt the whole<br />
Of her still body... there sprang a little blaze...<br />
A pack of hounds, the flame swept up the flue!--<br />
And the blue night stood flattened against the window,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">staring through.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_V_THE_WAGON_STOPPED_BEFORE_THE_HOUSE"></a>V-V THE WAGON STOPPED BEFORE THE HOUSE</h5>


<p>A wagon stopped before the house; she heard<br />
The heavy oilskins of the grocer's man<br />
Slapping against his legs. Of a sudden whirred<br />
Her heart like a frightened partridge, and she ran<br />
And slid the bolt, leaving his entrance free;<br />
Then in the cellar way till he was gone<br />
Hid, breathless, praying that he might not see<br />
The chair sway she had laid her hand upon<br />
In passing. Sour and damp from that dark vault<br />
Arose to her the well-remembered chill;<br />
She saw the narrow wooden stairway still<br />
Plunging into the earth, and the thin salt<br />
Crusting the crocks; until she knew him far,<br />
So stood, with listening eyes upon the empty doughnut<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">jar.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_VI_THEN_CAUTIOUSLY_SHE_PUSHED"></a>V-VI THEN CAUTIOUSLY SHE PUSHED</h5>


<p>Then cautiously she pushed the cellar door<br />
And stepped into the kitchen--saw the track<br />
Of muddy rubber boots across the floor,<br />
The many paper parcels in a stack<br />
Upon the dresser; with accustomed care<br />
Removed the twine and put the wrappings by,<br />
Folded, and the bags flat, that with an air<br />
Of ease had been whipped open skillfully,<br />
To the gape of children. Treacherously dear<br />
And simple was the dull, familiar task.<br />
And so it was she came at length to ask:<br />
How came the soda there? The sugar here?<br />
Then the dream broke. Silent, she brought the mop,<br />
And forced the trade-slip on the nail that held his<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">razor strop.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_VII_ONE_WAY_THERE_WAS"></a>V-VII ONE WAY THERE WAS</h5>


<p>One way there was of muting in the mind<br />
A little while the ever-clamorous care;<br />
And there was rapture, of a decent kind,<br />
In making mean and ugly objects fair:<br />
Soft-sooted kettle-bottoms, that had been<br />
Time after time set in above the fire,<br />
Faucets, and candlesticks, corroded green,<br />
To mine again from quarry; to attire<br />
The shelves in paper petticoats, and tack<br />
New oilcloth in the ringed-and-rotten's place,<br />
Polish the stove till you could see your face,<br />
And after nightfall rear an aching back<br />
In a changed kitchen, bright as a new pin,<br />
An advertisement, far too fine to cook a supper in.<br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_VIII_SHE_LET_THEM_LEAVE_THEIR_JELLIES"></a>V-VIII SHE LET THEM LEAVE THEIR JELLIES</h5>


<p>She let them leave their jellies at the door<br />
And go away, reluctant, down the walk.<br />
She heard them talking as they passed before<br />
The blind, but could not quite make out their talk<br />
For noise in the room--the sudden heavy fall<br />
And roll of a charred log, and the roused shower<br />
Of snapping sparks; then sharply from the wall<br />
The unforgivable crowing of the hour.<br />
One instant set ajar, her quiet ear<br />
Was stormed and forced by the full rout of day:<br />
The rasp of a saw, the fussy cluck and bray<br />
Of hens, the wheeze of a pump, she needs must hear;<br />
She inescapably must endure to feel<br />
Across her teeth the grinding of a backing wagon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">wheel.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_IX_NOT_OVER_KIND_NOR_OVER_QUICK"></a>V-IX NOT OVER-KIND NOR OVER-QUICK</h5>


<p>Not over-kind nor over-quick in study<br />
Nor skilled in sports nor beautiful was he,<br />
Who had come into her life when anybody<br />
Would have been welcome, so in need was she.<br />
They had become acquainted in this way:<br />
He flashed a mirror in her eyes at school;<br />
By which he was distinguished; from that day<br />
They went about together, as a rule.<br />
She told, in secret and with whispering,<br />
How he had flashed a mirror in her eyes;<br />
And as she told, it struck her with surprise<br />
That this was not so wonderful a thing.<br />
But what's the odds?--It's pretty nice to know<br />
You've got a friend to keep you company everywhere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">you go.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_X_SHE_HAD_FORGOTTEN"></a>V-X SHE HAD FORGOTTEN</h5>


<p>She had forgotten how the August night<br />
Was level as a lake beneath the moon,<br />
In which she swam a little, losing sight<br />
Of shore; and how the boy, that was at noon<br />
Simple enough, not different from the rest,<br />
Wore now a pleasant mystery as he went,<br />
Which seemed to her an honest enough test<br />
Whether she loved him, and she was content.<br />
So loud, so loud the million crickets' choir . . .<br />
So sweet the night, so long-drawn-out and late . . .<br />
And if the man were not her spirit's mate,<br />
Why was her body sluggish with desire?<br />
Stark on the open field the moonlight fell,<br />
But the oak tree's shadow was deep and black and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">secret as a well.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XI_IT_CAME_INTO_HER_MIND"></a>V-XI IT CAME INTO HER MIND</h5>


<p>It came into her mind, seeing how the snow<br />
Was gone, and the brown grass exposed again,<br />
And clothes-pins, and an apron--long ago,<br />
In some white storm that sifted through the pane<br />
And sent her forth reluctantly at last<br />
To gather in, before the line gave way,<br />
Garments, board-stiff, that galloped on the blast<br />
Clashing like angel armies in a fray,<br />
An apron long ago in such a night<br />
Blown down and buried in the deepening drift,<br />
To lie till April thawed it back to sight,<br />
Forgotten, quaint and novel as a gift--<br />
It struck her, as she pulled and pried and tore,<br />
That here was spring, and the whole year to be lived<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">through once more.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XII_TENDERLY_IN_THOSE_TIMES"></a>V-XII TENDERLY, IN THOSE TIMES</h5>


<p>Tenderly, in those times, as though she fed<br />
An ailing child--with sturdy propping up<br />
Of its small, feverish body in the bed,<br />
And steadying of its hands about the cup--<br />
She gave her husband of her body's strength,<br />
Thinking of men, what helpless things they were,<br />
Until he turned and fell asleep at length,<br />
And stealthily stirred the night and spoke to her.<br />
Familiar, at such moments, like a friend,<br />
Whistled far off the long, mysterious train,<br />
And she could see in her mind's vision plain<br />
The magic World, where cities stood on end . . .<br />
Remote from where she lay--and yet--between,<br />
Save for something asleep beside her, only the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">window screen.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XIII_FROM_THE_WAN_DREAM"></a>V-XIII FROM THE WAN DREAM</h5>


<p>From the wan dream that was her waking day,<br />
Wherein she journeyed, borne along the ground<br />
Without her own volition in some way,<br />
Or fleeing, motionless, with feet fast bound,<br />
Or running silent through a silent house<br />
Sharply remembered from an earlier dream,<br />
Upstairs, down other stairs, fearful to rouse,<br />
Regarding him, the wide and empty scream<br />
Of a strange sleeper on a malignant bed,<br />
And all the time not certain if it were<br />
Herself so doing or some one like to her,<br />
From this wan dream that was her daily bread,<br />
Sometimes, at night, incredulous, she would wake--<br />
A child, blowing bubbles that the chairs and carpet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">did not break!</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XIV_SHE_HAD_A_HORROR"></a>V-XIV SHE HAD A HORROR</h5>


<p>She had a horror he would die at night.<br />
And sometimes when the light began to fade<br />
She could not keep from noticing how white<br />
The birches looked--and then she would be afraid,<br />
Even with a lamp, to go about the house<br />
And lock the windows; and as night wore on<br />
Toward morning, if a dog howled, or a mouse<br />
Squeaked in the floor, long after it was gone<br />
Her flesh would sit awry on her. By day<br />
She would forget somewhat, and it would seem<br />
A silly thing to go with just this dream<br />
And get a neighbor to come at night and stay.<br />
But it would strike her sometimes, making the tea:<br />
<i>She had kept that kettle boiling all night long, for</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;"><i>company.</i></span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XV_THERE_WAS_UPON_THE_SILL"></a>V-XV THERE WAS UPON THE SILL</h5>


<p>There was upon the sill a pencil mark,<br />
Vital with shadow when the sun stood still<br />
At noon, but now, because the day was dark,<br />
It was a pencil mark upon the sill.<br />
And the mute clock, maintaining ever the same<br />
Dead moment, blank and vacant of itself,<br />
Was a pink shepherdess, a picture frame,<br />
A shell marked Souvenir, there on the shelf.<br />
Whence it occurred to her that <i>he</i> might be,<br />
The mainspring being broken in his mind,<br />
A clock himself, if one were so inclined,<br />
That stood at twenty minutes after three--<br />
The reason being for this, it might be said,<br />
That things in death were neither clocks nor people,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">but only dead.</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XVI_THE_DOCTOR_ASKED_HER"></a>V-XVI THE DOCTOR ASKED HER</h5>


<p>The doctor asked her what she wanted done<br />
With him, that could not lie there many days.<br />
And she was shocked to see how life goes on<br />
Even after death, in irritating ways;<br />
And mused how if he had not died at all<br />
'Twould have been easier--then there need not be<br />
The stiff disorder of a funeral<br />
Everywhere, and the hideous industry,<br />
And crowds of people calling her by name<br />
And questioning her, she'd never seen before,<br />
But only watching by his bed once more<br />
And sitting silent if a knocking came . . .<br />
She said at length, feeling the doctor's eyes,<br />
"I don't know what you do exactly when a person<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">dies."</span><br /></p>




<h5><a id="V_XVII_GAZING_UPON_HIM_NOW"></a>V-XVII GAZING UPON HIM NOW</h5>


<p>Gazing upon him now, severe and dead,<br />
It seemed a curious thing that she had lain<br />
Beside him many a night in that cold bed,<br />
And that had been which would not be again.<br />
From his desirous body the great heat<br />
Was gone at last, it seemed, and the taut nerves<br />
Loosened forever. Formally the sheet<br />
Set forth for her to-day those heavy curves<br />
And lengths familiar as the bedroom door.<br />
She was as one that enters, sly, and proud,<br />
To where her husband speaks before a crowd,<br />
And sees a man she never saw before--<br />
The man who eats his victuals at her side,<br />
Small, and absurd, and hers: for once, not hers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.8em;">unclassified.</span><br /></p>

States without permission and without paying copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
